- User registration and login (session-based)
- Password reset via email (PHPMailer)
- View and search user's appointments
- Book, cancel, and modify appointments
- Filter doctors by service
- Only logged-in users can access appointments
- Prevent double-booking

- Frontend: Bootstrap + Vanilla JS
- MySQL database with phpMyAdmin
- Dockerized setup

## Sample Credentials

You can log in with the following user:

```
Email: test@gmail.com
Password: test
```

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8+

   cd appointment-booking-system
   ```

   docker-compose up --build
   ```

     Login: `root / root`  
     DB: `appointment_system`

## Reset Password Logic

- Users can request a password reset.
- System sends a reset link via email (token-based).
- Repeated rapid requests wonâ€™t trigger multiple emails.

## Database

A sample SQL file for creating and populating the database is included in the `initdb/` folder.

## Notes

- The `vendor/` folder is excluded via `.gitignore`.
- Run `composer install` after cloning.
